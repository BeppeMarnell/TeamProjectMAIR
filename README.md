# Welcome to MAIRDISY (MAIR DIalog SYstem).

The project consists in designing, implementing, evaluating and writing about a restaurant recommendations dialog system using various methods from AI, such as domain modeling, text classification using machine learning and user experience testing. The dialog system is programmed in Python 3. The program is terminal/command line based. No graphical user interface was used. 

The project is divided into two parts: 

- The first part of the project concerns the implementation of the dialog system: modeling the domain in a dialog model, and implementing and evaluating a machine learning classifier for natural language. 
- The second part of the project is about evaluating your system: designing, carrying out and reporting on user experiments, as well as thinking about your system in the wider context of AI.
